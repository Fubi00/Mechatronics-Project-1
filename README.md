# Mechatronics-Project-1
This project consists of work related to designing the lifting mechanism for a fork-lift. The project is related to MAS238 (25h) at UiA.


Requirements given by the project

Safe woking load(SWL) = 1500 kg
Liftinf height capacity = 1.8 m
Propulsion type = Electric
Lifting and tilting mechanism = Hydraulic
Hoist time = 6 seconds
Tilting angle = +- 5 degrees
Tilting time = 3 seconds
Top speed = 15 km/h
Atmosphere = Dry and humid air
Operating temperature = 5 to 30 degrees Celsius
Number of lifting operations without failure = 300,000
Lifting and lowering without overheating = Continuous
Simultaneous lifting and tilting (-5 to +5 to -5) = 6 seconds
