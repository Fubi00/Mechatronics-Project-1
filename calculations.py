The system consists of forks for carying the load, a trolley that the forks are welded to, a tower (2 ish m), the main body of the forklift, and the two wheels.
These are split into their own bodys, and the mass center of each body is calculated.
A hydraulic cylinder is used to lift the trollt/forks with a chain, and the load is lifted by the forks.
